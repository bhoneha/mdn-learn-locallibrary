# mdn-learn-locallibrary
A Project for Learning Express

I have followed the step by step tutorial building this project from [MDN Webdocs Express.js Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs). It's a small library webapp with simple CRUD operations using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.
